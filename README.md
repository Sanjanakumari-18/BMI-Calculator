# BMI Calculator — Built with React

This BMI Calculator is a small project I created as part of my journey learning React. It allows users to input their weight and height, and instantly calculates their Body Mass Index (BMI) along with a message indicating their BMI category.

## Features

- Real-time BMI calculation based on user input
- Basic form validation to accept only positive numbers
- Gradient background and styled form container
- Displays BMI result and category: underweight, healthy, or overweight
- Built using functional React components and hooks

## What I Learned

This project helped me understand and practice the following concepts in React:

- Managing state with `useState`
- Handling form inputs and user events
- Conditional rendering based on calculations
- Styling components using both inline styles and Tailwind CSS
- Structuring a simple React application

It's not just about getting the code to work — it's also about learning how to think in components and build interactive, responsive interfaces.
